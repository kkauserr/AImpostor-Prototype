# 🎨 AImpostor – Figma Prototype Showcase

Welcome to the **AImpostor** prototype demo!  
This repository hosts an interactive **Figma prototype** embedded using GitHub Pages.

## 📌 Purpose

This project aims to:
- Make it easy to share and access clickable Figma prototypes.
- Provide a lightweight, public preview without needing Figma access.
- Raise awareness about the risks of AI-generated deepfakes through an intuitive sidebar concept.

## 🛠️ How It Works

- The `index.html` file includes an embedded `<iframe>` pointing to the Figma prototype.
- GitHub Pages serves this HTML as a live web page.
- Anyone with the link can interact with the prototype just like in Figma’s presentation mode.

## 🧠 About AImpostor

AImpostor is a concept for a mobile browser extension designed to:
- Detect whether a video being watched is AI-generated.
- Display visual alerts via color codes.
- Offer a companion screen with educational resources about AI, deepfakes, and digital safety — especially for vulnerable populations like older adults.
